I am a DPhil student at the University of Oxford, kindly supported by the Clarendon Scholarship and working at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience. Specifically, I am focusing on predictive coding - a local, energy based learning framework. My aim is to analyse the learning dynamics in predictive coding networks and find whether it can offer any advantages in standard machine learning tasks such as continual and online learning. Previously, I completed MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing also at Oxford and BSc in Theoretical Physics at University College London. I grew up in Georgia and moved to the UK at the start of my undergraduate degree.
